# Star_Wars
The app contains the following:
- Web api service created by .NET and C# as a backend.
- Angular 2+ as a frontend.

Make sure about the following configuration.
- To test the application using the localhost you have to run the webapi in port 1155.
- If you would like to change the webapi "the backend" port you have to change the baseurl variable in the angular app located in "src/environments/"
- Make sure to update the packages using command npm install -g npm@latest.
- ng serve for the root of the angular after running the webapi.
